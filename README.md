Welcome to the "funlightingsystems" project. 

The requirements for the project are as follows:

-Raspberry pi runs an Artnet server.
-Controllable with a Jands StageCL
-Python script running on a Pi receives the commands and send the information over serial to an arduino
-The arduino receives the information processes it and decides whether or not to turn on the light.
-RGB lights is preferred but not required
-Fully open source
-Runs OFFLINE
-IPad works as monitor to see if the information is being processed from the Jands StageCL


To view the current progress see the "ROADMAP.md" file.
