Welcome to the "funlightingsystems" project. 



The requirements for the project are as follows:



-Raspberry pi runs an Artnet server.

-Controllable with a Jands StageCL

-Python script running on a Pi receives the commands and send the information over serial to an arduino

-The arduino receives the information processes it and decides whether or not to turn on the light.

-RGB lights is preferred but not required

-Fully open source

-Runs OFFLINE

-IPad works as monitor to see if the information is being processed from the Jands StageCL



To view the current progress see the "ROADMAP.md" file.
